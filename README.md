# Predicting-Obesity-Levels
This repository contains the predictions of obesity levels of patients based on their eating habits and physical condition. The target variable, the obesity level, is a 7-level target variable, making this project different from a binary classification model. To make the predictions on obesity levels, a Random Forest Classifier Model is used.

## Dataset For Analysis
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544). The data collected covered  demographic data as well as data on eating habits and physical condition from individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico. 

The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records. The target attribute is the Obesity Level (OBLEVEL), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III (seven levels). The feature attributes related to eating habits are Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC), Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of food between meals (CAEC), Consumption of water daily (CH20), and Consumption of alcohol (CALC). The feature attributes related to physical condition are Calories consumption monitoring (SCC), Physical activity frequency (FAF), Time using technology devices (TUE), Transportation used (MTRANS). Demographic attributes such as Gender (GENDER), Age (AGE), Height (HEIGHT) and Weight (WEIGHT) were also recorded.

The dataset contains no missing values, implying that the model used has no use for imputing missing values.
