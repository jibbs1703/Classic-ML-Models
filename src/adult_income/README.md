# Adult Income Classification Model

## Data Processing and Preparation
This project processes and prepares data for training machine learning models. The steps include data extraction, preprocessing, splitting into training, testing, and validation sets, resampling, and loading the datasets into a target S3 bucket.

## Model Training
The model is trained using parameters derived from experimental runs in the experiments notebook. The experiments folder mimics
mlflow experimentations and parameter logging. The threshold for splitting probabilities into either categories of the targey is
also determined.
